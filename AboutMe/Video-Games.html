  <h1>Why I Started Playing</h1>
  <p> I started playing video games when I was seven years old, i would go over to my friends house and play Halo 3. At the time I did not have an Xbox but i really wanted one so for a long time I harrassed my mom to get Santa to get me an Xbox for Christmas.
    Finally in 2010 I finally got an Xbox and a few games to go with it. The first game I ever owned was Call of Duty Black Ops.</p>

  <h2>First Gaming Experience</h2>
  <p> I instantly fell in love with video games when I played them. On christmas that year I hooked up the xbox and started playing and my mom was shocked at how much blood and vilance was used in the games but it was so cool and realistic to me. Now the modern
    day games that are out right now are either fantasy or not realistic at all. </p>
  <h2>Current Games</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Smite</li>
    <li>Fortnite</li>
    <li>Call of Duty Infinite Warfare</li>
    <li>No Man's Sky</li>
    <li>Destiny 2</li>
  </ol>
